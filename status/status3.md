# Status update 3

## Recap of what was planned for the last 3 weeks 
- We got a working web app to run which can upload photos and extract metadata into a data structure. We are planning to start formatting that metadata into user-friendly tags which is what most of our time will go into.
## Tasks Completed What was done during the last 3 weeks (by whom) 
1. Description of tasks completed
- Buck created a project outline and added basic functionality for uploading photos, selecting tags, and downloading results (25 hours).
- Matty worked on filtering superfluous tags and building logic for composing human-usable tags from existing metadata. (Still in progress at the time of writing this. 5 hours)
- Connor added backend functionality to store photo paths and tags in a database (5 hours)
- Cody worked on improving the look of generated tags to appear more user friendly / less confusing. Attended both meetings. Rewrote 30 lines of html code.
2. Your choice of quantifiable metric(s)
(e.g., hours, lines of code, meeting count, doc/test coverage %,...)

## Successes
1. What are your accomplishments?
- We have a working skeleton to build off of for the time being.
2. What solutions were successful?
- Using online video guides for backend creation was very helpful for getting the project off the ground.
3. Were there other things that you tried that did not work and why?
- We tried different database schemas for storing photos, with some of them being more or less successful than others (some photos are too large to store in the database, so we only store their paths). 
## Roadblocks/Challenges
1. Describe the challenges
- Starting the project and deciding how to structure it was a challenge. Finding time for all of us to work on the project together has also been an issue.
2. Describe how you overcame them
- We started by looking at videos on how to create a front and backend in react and how to get them to communicate one with another. This got the basic framework built up for us. We plan on meeting at least once every week to work on and discuss the project.
3. What challenges are still left?
- We really need to polish the user experience so that the site is easier to use. We also need to fix a problem with tags not getting the proper images. 
4. What do you need help with? How can your mentor help?
- We have met with Lars and got some good feedback on the user experience outlook on our current project. Just intermittent checkups and opinions would be useful to us
## Changes/Deviation from Plan ​(if applicable - if not, say so!)
- We want to put more focus on the UI and less on the backend. This means our product will be less robust, especially when used by multiple people, but it will allow us to create a more visually pleasing UI with lots of features.
## Details Description of Goals/ Plan for ​Next 3 Weeks [5pts]
- Get the website to display images. 
- Start grouping our pairs into proper one-statement tags
- Fix database sharing issue
- Custom group features
- Trim non-useful tags for a better user experience
## Confidence on completion from each team member + team average [5 pts]
Scale of 1-5; 1 = not-confident; 3 = toss-up; 5 = confident
Buck- 3.5
Cody - 3.5
Connor - 3
Matty - 4
Average - 3.5
