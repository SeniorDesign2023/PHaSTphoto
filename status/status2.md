1. Recap
  - Over the last few weeks, we hammered down our minimum viable product. We met with Lars and discussed what technologies we want to use. As of now, they are Chat GPT, NodeJS, Express, React, MongoDB, and Microsoft Azure. We have done a lot of brainstorming regarding what our product will actually do if we are going to do pre-tag or post-tag on the photos. 
3. Tasks Completed
  - Buck: Generated idea for minimum viable product
  - Connor: Came up with a better layout for our application and outlined how the user is going to interact with it.
  - Matty: Started planning reasonable additional features for once minimum viable product has been achieved and drawing out how they would integrate into our current proposed UI.
  - Cody: Assisted Connor and Buck in brainstorming ideas for the minimum viable product and UI designs.
4. Successes
  - We met and outlined the minimal viable product. We have settled on the majority of the technologies that we will plan to use for the product. We plan to make a final decision on the desktop vs. web app discussion (we want to discuss this with Lars). If we do decide on a web app, we have decided to use Microsoft Azure as a web hosting service, with a contingency plan to have AARC host our app. 
5. Roadblocks/challenges
  - The main challenge is that all members of our group have been really busy this semester so we haven't had the opportunity to begin solid work on the project.
  - We have not overcome these challenges, but plan to put in a large amount of work over Christmas Break.
  - We could use help from a mentor to set specific milestones for the project.
  - We aren’t sure if we want this to be a web app or a desktop app. A web app would be easier to use and more accessible, but a desktop app would make local photo management easier and would negate the issue of having to include cloud storage.
  - We aren’t sure how we want to manage the photos (only display them in the app, allow the user to download an organized folder, or move photos locally). 
6. Changes/Deviations
  - We have decided that we do not want to include the ability to choose from different addons. For now, we want to focus on only using ChatGPT to tag the photos.
  - Are currently ignoring our original idea to include And/Or logic and the option to use parentheses to execute these options, as we believe they are not intuitive enough for the general target user of this application.
7. Confidence
  - Buck: 3
  - Cody: 2.5
  - Connor: 3
  - Matty: 3.5
  - Average: 3
8. Group Dynamic
  - Our group is working well. The communication is good, and we are all contributing. Our meetings have been very productive as we have thrown around a lot of ideas and discussions have been very respectful.
