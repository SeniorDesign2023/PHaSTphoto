Project Questions

1. What went well: As a team we are all working together very well. We have great brainstorming sessions and all have good ideas that are being shared around. We feel confident in the completion of our product. Our goals are realistic, and we have received suggestions from our mentor that we believe we will be able to implement.

2. What didn’t go well: We have yet to get a start on the project past the planning phase. We have also struggled with locking in on the technologies that we are going to use. Most of our original ideas have changed, so our current plan is relatively new and may present challenges we have not thought of.

3. What we have learned: A sizable project takes a lot of planning and includes lots of changes to original ideas. We have learned how to define a reasonable scope for the project and how to properly set goals and milestones. During our planning, we have also explored some of the technologies that we plan on using (JS, React, database services, …). 

4. Current issues/problems: We are still unsure of exactly what we want the different aspects of our project to look like and how we want them to function. We have yet to make any final design choices regarding the front-end, back-end, database use, tagging service(s), or filtering options.  


Recommendations

1. What went well: What should be continued is the group presentations that happened during class time. We liked how we were able to hear the successes and failures of each of the groups. 

2. What didn’t go well: What we would like to see in the future classes is some distinct milestones from the teachers for us to reach for. This would help take some of the stress out of the time management of the project. We think that, as part of those class meetings, it would be helpful to strictly schedule meetings with mentors, as we found their guidance very helpful for dialing in what we wanted our project to look like.
