# Status Update 4


## Recap of what was planned for the last 3 weeks 
- We have made plans to expand our tagging capabilities, improve the UI, add page navigation functionality, and display the uploaded images on the page. 
## Tasks Completed What was done during the last 3 weeks (by whom) 
1. Description of tasks completed & quantifiable metrics
- Buck: Fixed bug where only string values would be evaluated property in the database. Now numerical values are properly evaluated (2 hours).
- Matty: implemented functions to ignore impertinent tags as well as perform custom tag creation based on logic applied to metadata. Looked into ways to better communicate geospatial data to our audience (6 hours)
- Connor: Implemented persistent photo storage and the ability to delete all stored photos. (2 hours)
- Cody: Changed tag selection page to sort tags into containers based on the tag’s key. Looked into different design options for the tag selection page. Looked for ways to display thumbnails of uploaded photos. Helped test custom tag creation functions with Matty (3.5 hours)
## Successes
1. What are your accomplishments?
- We met and had a group work session to work on the project and assign further tasks.
- We made progress on the UI of the product, including better formatting the tags so that they don’t appear in one straight line. They are now properly grouped into their designated sections. 
- We fixed bugs with how the photo tags were being stored and used to retrieve photos.
- We now allow the user to continue uploading photos to the database. They can delete all stored photos with a button.
2. What solutions were successful?
- Some of our most successful solutions were pairing more than one programmer on a problem so that we had two brains working on a problem at once. This was especially useful in debugging as we had one person actively working on the problem, while the other tested incremental solutions.
- Meeting in person to work on the project was productive. It gave us the opportunity to discuss successes and challenges in-depth and find a way to work around them as a team.
3. Were there other things that you tried that did not work and why?
- We tried putting deadlines on projects that we wanted to get done. This did not work amazingly as most of us procrastinated and just quickly did the project at the very end of the deadline, making all the other time mostly wasted. We think that since the deadlines were too long they didn’t put enough pressure to get the project done in a timely manner. We plan to break down our goals into smaller, more detailed milestones to spread them out over a more consistent timeline.
## Roadblocks/Challenges
1. Describe the challenges
- We are struggling to find the time to work on the product as it feels that other classes take precedence over senior design class. We are also struggling to work collaboratively/individually on the product and are ending up getting most of the work done during our weekly meetings instead of on our own time. We are also unsure how to design the site to be both user-friendly and highly customizable.
2. Describe how you overcame them
- We plan to be more time-conscious and to have more time integrity when working on the project. We also plan to have a good discussion with Lars on how to maximize the amount of time and work that we can get done in the short amount of time that we have left to work on the project. 
3. What challenges are still left?
- We need to really flesh out the product as it still feels like only a skeleton. We need to get some substantial “meat on the bones” for it to feel like a well put together product.
- We need to figure out how to store and retrieve thumbnails to/from the database without using too much data for each photo.
4. What do you need help with? How can your mentor help?
- Having some resources pointed out would be extremely helpful, especially in terms of front-end design tools.
- We need help generating specific goals and deadlines to make sure that our product is fleshed out by the due date. Our mentor can help set these goals and deadlines for each individual and maybe give us some pointers on how to more collaboratively work together.
- We may need advice on specific design choices for how the website looks and feels. What features could be added to make our website more useful?
## Changes/Deviation from Plan ​(if applicable - if not, say so!)
- We are intending for our website to be used by a user for a single session at a time. Certain limitations on how we can store and retrieve photos require our website to be used this way.
## Details Description of Goals/ Plan for ​Next 3 Weeks [5pts]
- Our goals for the next 3 weeks are to meet with Lars and come up with a plan of attack on how to maximize the functionality of the product in the short amount of time that we have left. We are then going to attack the code with a fiery vigor and implement as many new features as possible to give the end user as much customizability as possible. We plan to have some more meat on the bones at the end of these three weeks. 
## Confidence on completion from each team member + team average [5 pts]
Scale of 1-5; 1 = not-confident; 3 = toss-up; 5 = confident
- Buck- 3
- Cody - 3
- Connor - 3
- Matty - 4
- Average - 3.25
