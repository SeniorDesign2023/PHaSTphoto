# Status Update 1

## Recap of the Last 3 Weeks
1. As a group, we discussed ways to expand on our project idea according to 
feedback on our project pitch. The main issue was that many photo management 
tools already exist that incorporate auto tagging of photos, so our idea had 
already been done. Instead, we decided that we will focus on creating an 
interesting user interface and more advanced ways to search/filter photos.

## Tasks Completed
1. Connor started the initial planning document and wrote the team bio, project summary, and niche sections of the document. He contributed to the recap, tasks completed, changes/deviation, and confidence sections of this document.
2. Matty wrote out the timeline for how we planned to accomplish the idea and made edits to the major components and summary so that the ideas displayed were cohesive and also encompassed all facets of the project. 
3. Buck edited the summary and worked on the major components/resources. He also reviewed the document for turning in and printed copies for the presentation.
4. Cody helped come up with some of the major components/resources and helped revise the timeline.
5. Spoke with Jim and Lars after class on 9/26 to discuss ways to make our app more unique (Group).
6. We all met three times to discuss new plans for the project and put together our status update during our meeting 10/6.

## Successes
1. We were able to successfully present our project and received constructive feedback from our mentors about what we needed to do. This helped us realize that we need to find a pinpoint focus on what exactly our photo management software will do. As of now, we want to focus on developing a detailed UI and creative ways to sort photos based on tags picked from an input phrase.
2. At this point we have not tried anything new and thus do not have anything that did not work. Once we meet with our mentors, we will be able to narrow our focus.

## Roadblocks/Challenges
1. Upon presenting our idea to the class, some criticism was posed towards the originality of our idea. The level of difficulty and time requirement was also brought up, which we had thought of previously and was mentioned in our planning document. Due to these issues, we for certain will need to diverge from our original plan. We are just not sure at the moment to what extent we will need to do so.
2. We are still not one hundred percent sure on how our project will sort/manage the photos. We are still trying to find the exact niche of photo management software that we are trying to fit into. This is the main challenge that is still left right now for our group to figure out.
3. We will most likely need some assistance on finding the exact product niche that we are looking to fill, and I do believe that our mentor would be a great help for this. We will talk with our mentor in the next few days to help us resolve this issue.

## Changes/Deviations from the Project Pitch
1. After receiving criticism on our project pitch, we realized that we will need to either edit our current proposal or completely come up with a new idea. Our original idea has already been done by many companies, and not very well.
2. Our current leading prospect for an alteration to the project is to build an advanced filtering system that uses an already available auto-tagging AI and fits in a robust user interface that is based on file links for user interaction.

## Confidence on completion of the project for each team member and the group average
Scale of 1-5; 1 = not-confident; 3 = toss-up; 5 = confident.
- Buck - 3 
- Connor - 3
- Cody - 2.5 on current project plan.
- Matty - 3.5 whatever we finally decide on, I am confident in our ability to accomplish it. I think we just need some help at this point on narrowing down the direction that we want to go now that our original plan has been at least partially scrapped.
- Average: 3

## Group Dynamics
1. Our group is working well so far. We are holding meetings, discussing problems, and working together on the various documents that have been assigned to us. We are all also brainstorming ways to better focus our project idea and plan out the roadmap for it.
