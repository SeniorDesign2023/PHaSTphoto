# Status Update 1

## Recap of the Last 3 Weeks
1. As a group, we discussed ways to expand on our project idea according to 
feedback on our project pitch and a meeting with Lars. The main issue was that many photo management 
tools already exist that incorporate auto tagging of photos, so our idea had 
already been done. Instead, we decided that we will focus on creating an 
interesting user interface and more advanced ways to search/filter photos.

## Tasks Completed
1. Connor started the initial planning document and wrote the team bio, project summary, and niche sections of the document. He contributed to the recap, tasks completed, changes/deviation, and confidence sections of this document.
2. Matty wrote out the timeline for how we planned to accomplish the idea and made edits to the major components and summary so that the ideas displayed were cohesive and also encompassed all facets of the project. 
3. Buck edited the summary and worked on the major components/resources. He also reviewed the document for turning in and printed copies for the presentation.
4. Cody helped come up with some of the major components/resources and helped revise the timeline.
5. Spoke with Jim and Lars after class on 9/26 to discuss ways to make our app more unique (Group).
6. We met three times to discuss new plans for the project and put together our status update during our meeting 10/6 (Group).
7. We met with Lars on 10/10 to get some ideas and improve our project plan (Group). 

## Successes
1. We successfully presented our project and received constructive feedback from our mentors about what we needed to do to improve our project idea. This helped us realize that we need to find a pinpoint focus on what exactly our photo management software will do. As of now, we want to focus on developing a detailed UI and creative ways to sort photos based on tags picked from an input phrase. Also, we met with Lars and came up with some interesting features we could implement to improve our project.
2. We decided that training our own AI to tag photos would be impractical, so we plan on using existing services to tag photos. 

## Roadblocks/Challenges
1. Upon presenting our idea to the class, some criticism was posed towards the originality of our idea. The level of difficulty and time requirement was also brought up, which we had thought of previously and was mentioned in our planning document. Due to these issues, we will need to diverge from our original plan. The changes section describes how we are modifying our plan.
2. After our meeting with Lars, we feel better about what direction our project is headed in. Currently, we do not have any significant challenges.
3. We will likely need help developing/changing our plan throughout the semester. We believe that our mentor will be helpful for suggesting modifications and providing resources.

## Changes/Deviations from the Project Pitch
1. After receiving criticism on our project pitch, we realized that we will need to either edit our current proposal or completely come up with a new idea. Our original idea has already been done by many companies.
2. Our current plan is to build an advanced filtering system that uses an already available auto-tagging AI and fits in a robust user interface that is based on file links for user interaction. As of now, we want to program it using HTML and JavaScript.
3. Here are some possible features we came up with during our meeting with Lars:
- Boolean search queries (Photos of: X AND Y)
- Metadata-based search
- Give outlines/fields for search queries
- Suggest common tags or tags that appear in many photos
- Generate summary stats on tags or metadata
- Allow users to edit and make their own tags
- Use multiple auto-tagging services to give a confidence %
- Let users rerun the auto-tagging feature
- Let user manage which auto-tagging services are used
- Use metadata to infer tags
- Track views and edits
- Make a photo timeline/slider
- Real-time search result updates as the user types in a query

## Confidence on completion of the project for each team member and the group average
Scale of 1-5; 1 = not-confident; 3 = toss-up; 5 = confident.
- Buck - 3 
- Connor - 3
- Cody - 4
- Matty - 3.5 whatever we finally decide on, I am confident in our ability to accomplish it. I think we just need some help at this point on narrowing down the direction that we want to go now that our original plan has been at least partially scrapped.
- Average: 3.375

## Group Dynamics
1. Our group is working well so far. We are holding meetings, discussing problems, and working together on the various documents that have been assigned to us. We are all also brainstorming ways to better focus our project idea and plan out the roadmap for it.
