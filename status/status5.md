# Status Update 5


## Recap of what was planned for the last 3 weeks 
- We made plans to redesign the user experience by updating the UI and making the app easier to use/understand. We are also working on getting the displayed photos to update in real-time based on the selected tags.
## Tasks Completed What was done during the last 3 weeks (by whom) 
1. Description of tasks completed & quantifiable metrics
- Buck: Added Chat GPT tagging functionality (15 hours)
- Matty: worked on implementing a live update feature in the display to only show pictures that are relevant in the context of selected tags. This is still in progress as we need to fit it in with a database query in the backend. Had to spend some time figuring out how the frontend worked since I had been mostly working in the backend until this task. Spent time drafting a logo. (10 hours)
- Connor: redesigned UI and page layout of the tag uploading page. Added the ability to name the download folder (6 hours).
- Cody: Redesigned the entire UI to be more user friendly. Mainly the tag selection page. (12 hours)
## Successes
1. What are your accomplishments?
- Refactored backend logic for custom tagging
- Added optional ChatGPT generated tags
- Redesigned UI to be much more appealing
- Improved functionality for uploading and deleting photos
2. What solutions were successful?
- Everyone put time into the project independently which helped us make a substantial amount of progress. 
- Some of us have collaborated on improvements.
3. Were there other things that you tried that did not work and why?
- We tried to get live updates done, but that is still in progress at the time of writing this 
## Roadblocks/Challenges
1. Describe the challenges
- Different elements of the UI weren’t displaying together cohesively when new changes were being added.
- Matty really hit a snag in understanding how the photos were being displayed in the frontend. (This has been cleared up and we are all on the same page about it now.)
2. Describe how you overcame them
- Redesigned the html structure to allow for better UI changes.
- Got together and explained how photos were being passed from backend to frontend.
3. What challenges are still left?
- Currently, operations are somewhat slow. This goes up to very slow when a chat GPT tagger is put into the mix. We would like to get this sped up to more appropriately match the name of the product.
- Live updates are still being worked on. This should be done before the end of the design phase.
- Making photos expand when you click and hold them.
- There are still many tags that could be displayed that should probably be blacklisted from displaying. Adding all of these tags to our blacklist would take a lot of time.
4. What do you need help with? How can your mentor help?
- We are pretty happy with how our project looks right now and have solid plans for final things that we want to clean up. Suggestions for improvements/changes to our project are always welcomed.
## Changes/Deviation from Plan ​(if applicable - if not, say so!)
- It actually looks more similar to our original plans than the initial deviations that we had made. The new plan is the old plan.

## Details Description of Goals/ Plan for ​Next 3 Weeks [5pts]
- Finish implementing the live update feature on the display.
- Work in an option for users to input a chat gpt api key in order to use GPT generated tags. We are thinking this will take the form of a slider to turn the function on as well as display an input box.
- We still need to film our infomercial.
- Further improvements could include adding the option to select from multiple different tagging services, increasing the speed of the tagging process, allowing for connections to external photo storage locations, or improving the customizability of tags.
